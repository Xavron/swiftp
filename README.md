forBackups branch
===================

forBackups is my main branch of Swiftp that I push out all finished updates to. It may often include newer changes and fixes.

2024 Feb: It has Android 11+ storage improvements, multi user with multi storage location use, and a test battery saver setting that heavily drops battery usage.
